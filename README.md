# <Prework Study Guide Webpage by Maggie>

## Description 

This is a study guide created for bootcamp students to be able to access their notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as they go through the course. This study guide will help anyone using it to stay more organized as they ingest a large amount of complex information. It was built to help keep notes and ideas organized and to be able to quickly reference different catagories of code being learned. Without a study guide like this one, students might get the different code languages mixed up with one another.Sectioning these out will help keep each language separate in their minds.

Each time we refresh the page, a new study topic will appear.
